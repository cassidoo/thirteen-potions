You are a knight who has to collect the 13 potions in the castle as fast as possible. But be careful, there's 13 ghosts who want to slow you down!

(my current fastest time is 52 seconds, lmk if you beat me)

## Why

This is my first attempt at game dev for [js13kgames 2023](https://js13kgames.com/)! I misread the rules and didn't realize that the game framework I picked would count towards the game size (classic) but it's my first time making a real game with a framework so I'm going to take it!

## How

I used [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) as the framework, some [Kenney assets](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon) for the tileset, [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for updating individual tiles and making my own sprites, and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) for creating the map! It was my first time using all of these tools so I might not have done it perfectly, so don't use this code as a role model for anything besides good ol' fun.
